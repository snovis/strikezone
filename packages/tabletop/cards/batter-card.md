# BATTER CARD

## YOUR TURN

### 1. SELECT (secretly)
Pick **action** + **guesses**:

| Action | |
|--------|---|
| SWING | Commit to swing |
| TAKE | Watch pitch go by |

| Pitch Guess | If Correct | If Wrong | If Fooled* |
|-------------|------------|----------|------------|
| Fastball / Changeup / Breaking | +1 | -1 | -2 |
| None | +0 | — | — |

*Fooled = guessed what their pitch beats (FB beats CB, CB beats CH, CH beats FB)

| Location Guess | If Correct | If Wrong |
|----------------|------------|----------|
| UP / DOWN / IN / OUT / MID | +1 | -1 |
| None | +0 | — |

---

### 2. REVEAL
Both players reveal. Calculate your modifiers.

---

### 3. WAIT FOR PITCHER
Pitcher rolls execution → You learn the zone.

---

### 4. HOLD-UP CHECK (if needed)
**Only if:** You chose SWING but pitch is in BALL zone.

Roll 2d6 + modifiers, need **7+** to hold up:

| Modifier | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Location guess correct | +2 |
| 2 strikes | -3 |
| Breaking ball | -1 |

- **7+ = Hold up!** → Ball called
- **<7 = Chase!** → Continue to contact roll

---

### 5. CONTACT ROLL (if swinging)
Roll 2d6 + all modifiers (capped at ±3):

| Total | Contact |
|-------|---------|
| ≤3 | MISS → Strike |
| 4-9 | WEAK → Outcome roll |
| 10+ | STRONG → Outcome roll |

---

### 6. OUTCOME ROLL

**WEAK contact** — Roll 2d6:
| Total | Result |
|-------|--------|
| ≤5 | Out |
| 6-10 | Foul |
| 11+ | Single |

**STRONG contact** — Roll 2d6:
| Total | Result |
|-------|--------|
| ≤5 | Single |
| 6-8 | Double |
| 9+ | HOME RUN |

---

## PROTECT MODE (optional, 2 strikes only)

With 2 strikes, you may DECLARE **"Protect"** when selecting.

| | Normal | Protect |
|--|--------|---------|
| Contact modifier | +0 | **+2** |
| Strong contact | Full outcomes | Capped at Weak |

**The choice:** Choke up for contact, or swing for the fences?

- **Protect**: Easier to make contact (+2), but no extra-base hits
- **Normal**: Harder to connect, but can still crush it
