# BATTER CARD

## YOUR TURN

### 1. SELECT (secretly)

Pick your **APPROACH** and **SETUP**:

```
APPROACH
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  💪 POWER   - Swing for the fences  │
│  🎯 CONTROL - Controlled swing      │
│  ✋ CONTACT - Just make contact     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

SETUP (where you stand in the box)
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  BACK  - Deep in the box            │
│  ON    - Crowding the plate         │
│  FRONT - Up in the box              │
│  OFF   - Off the plate              │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Lineup hint:** Your batting position suggests your approach:
- 1-2: Control (table setters)
- 3-4: Power (run producers)
- 5-6: Control (professional ABs)
- 7-9: Contact (survival mode)

---

### 2. REVEAL

Both players reveal choices at the same time.

**Check the matchup (split modifier: you +1, they -1):**

| Their Pitch | Power | Control | Contact |
|-------------|:-----:|:-------:|:-------:|
| **Fastball** | You +1, They -1 | TIE | You -1, They +1 |
| **Curveball** | You -1, They +1 | You +1, They -1 | TIE |
| **Changeup** | TIE | You -1, They +1 | You +1, They -1 |

**Memory:** Power crushes FB, Control handles CB, Contact recognizes CH

**Check Setup vs Location:**
```
Cycle: UP → IN → DOWN → OUT → UP
       Back  On   Front  Off
```

| Their Location | Back | On | Front | Off |
|----------------|------|----|-------|-----|
| **UP** | 0 | -1 | 0 | +1 |
| **IN** | +1 | 0 | -1 | 0 |
| **DOWN** | 0 | +1 | 0 | -1 |
| **OUT** | -1 | 0 | +1 | 0 |

---

### 3. BATTLE ROLL

Both roll 2d6. Add your modifiers.

**Compare totals - higher wins!**

If YOU win, note your tier:
| Your Total | Tier |
|------------|------|
| ≤8 | Weak |
| 9-10 | Solid |
| 11+ | Strong |

**SNAKE EYES (1-1)?**
- You roll snake eyes → Automatic OUT
- Pitcher rolls snake eyes → You get automatic STRONG tier!

---

### 4. RESULT ROLL (if you won)

Roll 2d6 + setup modifier:

| Roll | Weak | Solid | Strong |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| ≤6 | OUT | 1B | 1B |
| 7-9 | 1B | 2B | 2B |
| 10+ | 1B+ | 2B+ | HR |

**1B+ or 2B+** = Stretch opportunity! Roll again:
- ≤8: Out (caught stretching)
- 9+: Safe at the extra base!
- Snake eyes: Out

**Snake eyes on result?** You're OUT (even though you won the battle).

---

## QUICK REFERENCE

```
MATCHUPS:
Power beats FB | Control beats CB | Contact beats CH

Setup maps to location cycle:
  Back=UP, On=IN, Front=DOWN, Off=OUT

Tiers: ≤8 Weak | 9-10 Solid | 11+ Strong

Weak tier warning: Low roll = OUT!
```
