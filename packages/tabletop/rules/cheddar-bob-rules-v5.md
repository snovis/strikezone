# CHEDDAR BOB: SPEED EDITION v5
## Complete Rules

---

# THE GAME

You are **playing baseball decisions**. Each at-bat is a battle of wits and dice between pitcher and batter. Choose your approach, commit to your selection, and let the dice decide.

**Core Philosophy:**
- Weak execution gives the opponent opportunities
- Strong execution limits opportunities
- The player trying to accomplish something rolls
- Snake eyes = critical failure for whoever rolled

---

# TURN FLOW

```
1. SELECT    Both secretly pick Approach + Location/Setup
2. STEAL?    Runner announces "going!" (commits blind)
3. REVEAL    Show choices simultaneously
   → If steal: Resolve steal roll, then back to step 1
4. BATTLE    Both roll 2d6 + modifiers, higher wins (ties reroll)
5. RESULT    Winner rolls for outcome
6. EXTRAS    Runner advancement, stretch attempts, etc.
```

---

# PHASE 1: SELECT

Both players secretly select their choices.

## Pitcher Selects

**APPROACH** (pick one):

| Pitch     | Symbol | Plus Available |
| --------- | ------ | -------------- |
| Fastball  | ⚡      | FASTBALL+      |
| Curveball | 🌀     | CURVEBALL+     |
| Changeup  | 🔄     | None (safe)    |

**LOCATION** (pick one arrow):
```
       ↑ UP
   ← IN    OUT →
       ↓ DOWN
```

## Batter Selects

**APPROACH** (pick one):

| Approach | Symbol | Plus Available |
| -------- | ------ | -------------- |
| Power    | 💪     | POWER+         |
| Control  | 🎯     | None (safe)    |
| Contact  | ✋      | CONTACT+       |

**LOCATION** (pick one arrow - same as pitcher):
```
       ↑ UP
   ← IN    OUT →
       ↓ DOWN
```

*Batter is guessing where the pitch will be thrown.*

---

# PHASE 2: STEAL ATTEMPT (Optional)

**High-stakes timing:** After SELECT, before REVEAL. Runner commits blind!

**Battle Roll:** Both players roll 2d6. Runner gets pitch modifier:

| Pitch Thrown | Modifier | Why |
|--------------|----------|-----|
| Fastball ⚡ | **-1** | Quick to the plate |
| Changeup 🔄 | 0 | Normal timing |
| Curveball 🌀 | **+1** | Slow delivery |

**Tie goes to the runner!**

| Result | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| Runner higher or tie | **SAFE** - Runner advances one base |
| Pitcher higher | **CAUGHT** - Runner out, at-bat continues |
| 🐍 Runner | **CAUGHT** - Critical failure |
| 🎲 Runner rolls 12 | **SAFE** - Auto success |
| 🐍 Pitcher | **EXTRA BASE** - Runner advances two bases! |
| 🎲 Pitcher rolls 12 | **CAUGHT** - Auto success |

**The Mind Game:**
- Pitcher thinks runner might go → throw FB to help catcher
- But FB is what the Power hitter wants!
- Throw CB for the strikeout? Runner steals easy with +1.
- Runner commits BLIND - high risk, high reward!

*Future: Player cards add speed modifiers*

**After steal resolves → Back to SELECT for the at-bat.**
The steal was its own play. Now fresh selections for the pitch!

---

# PHASE 3: REVEAL

Both players reveal simultaneously. Calculate modifiers:

## RPS Matchup (Approach vs Approach)

```
CB → Power → FB → Contact → CH → Control → CB
```

| Pitcher ↓ / Batter → |  Power   | Control  | Contact  |
| -------------------- | :------: | :------: | :------: |
| **Fastball**         | B+1, P-1 |   TIE    | P+1, B-1 |
| **Curveball**        | P+1, B-1 | B+1, P-1 |   TIE    |
| **Changeup**         |   TIE    | P+1, B-1 | B+1, P-1 |

**Memory:** Power crushes FB, Control handles CB, Contact reads CH

## Location (Arrow Comparison)

Both players reveal their arrow. Compare instantly:

| Comparison | Result | Example |
|------------|--------|---------|
| **Match** | B+1 | Both ↑ |
| **Opposite** | P+1 | ↑ vs ↓, or ← vs → |
| **Perpendicular** | TIE | ↑ vs ←, or ↓ vs → |

*Batter guessed right? Batter +1. Pitcher fooled 'em? Pitcher +1.*

**All modifiers apply to BATTLE roll only. They do NOT carry to result roll.**

---

# PHASE 4: BATTLE

Both players roll 2d6 and add their modifiers.

**Higher total wins.** Ties reroll.

## Determine Tier

The **winner's** modified total determines their tier:

| Winner's Total | Tier |
|----------------|------|
| ≤6 | **Weak** |
| 7-9 | **Solid** |
| 10+ | **Strong** |

## Snake Eyes in Battle

| Who Rolled 🐍 | Result                                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Pitcher       | Batter automatically gets **STRONG** tier |
| Batter        | Automatic **OUT** (skip result roll)      |

---

# PHASE 5: RESULT

The **winner** rolls 2d6 on their result table.

**No modifiers on result roll** - tier already determines your column.

## Batter Wins → Batter Rolls 2d6

| Roll |  Weak   | Solid | Strong |
| ---- | :-----: | :---: | :----: |
| ≤7   | **OUT** | OUT   |   1B   |
| 8-9  |   OUT   |  1B   |  2B+   |
| 10+  |   1B    |  2B+  | **HR** |

- **Snake eyes = OUT** (critical failure)
- **+ = Stretch opportunity** (battle roll)

## Pitcher Wins → Pitcher Rolls 2d6

| Roll | Weak | Solid | Strong |
|------|:----:|:-----:|:------:|
| ≤7 | **BB** | O+RA | K+RC |
| 8-9 | O+RA | K+RC | O-RF |
| 10+ | O+RC | O-RF | **DP!** |

**Legend:**
- **BB** = Walk (batter reaches base)
- **O** = Out (batter is out)
- **K** = Strikeout (batter is out)
- **RA** = Runners Advance freely
- **RC** = Runners advance with Challenge (battle roll, tie → runner)
- **RF** = Runners Frozen (no advancement)
- **DP!** = Guaranteed Double Play (if runner on 1st)

- **Snake eyes = HBP** (batter reaches, critical failure for pitcher)

---

# BASERUNNING

## Battle Rolls (Steal & Stretch)

**Tie goes to the runner!**

### Stretch Attempt (Batter rolled 1B+ or 2B+)

**Battle Roll:** Both roll 2d6, no modifiers.

| Result | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| Batter higher or tie | **SAFE** at extra base |
| Pitcher higher | **OUT** (caught stretching) |
| 🐍 Batter | **OUT** - Critical failure |
| 🎲 Batter rolls 12 | **SAFE** - Auto success |
| 🐍 Pitcher | **SAFE** - Critical failure |
| 🎲 Pitcher rolls 12 | **OUT** - Auto success |

### Runner Advancement on Outs

When pitcher gets an out with runners on base:

**Ground Ball - Double Play Attempt**
If runner on 1st, **Pitcher rolls 2d6:**

| Roll | Result |
|------|--------|
| 2 (snake eyes) | Error - all runners safe, batter safe |
| 3-8 | Single out only, runners advance |
| 9-10 | Single out, runners hold |
| 11+ | **DOUBLE PLAY** |

**Fly Ball / Line Out - Tag Up Attempt**
If runner on 3rd, **Batter rolls 2d6:**

| Roll | Result |
|------|--------|
| 2 (snake eyes) | Runner thrown out at home |
| 3-6 | Runner holds |
| 7+ | Runner scores (sac fly) |

*Modify based on out type: Lineout = harder, Deep fly = easier*

### Runner Advancement on Hits

| Hit Type | Tier | Runner on 1st | Runner on 2nd |
|----------|------|---------------|---------------|
| Single | Any | To 2nd | To 3rd |
| Double | Weak | To 3rd | Scores |
| Double | Solid | To 3rd | Scores |
| Double | Strong | **Scores** | Scores |
| Triple | Any | Scores | Scores |
| HR | Any | Scores | Scores |

# PLUS MOVES

Declare plus moves during SELECT phase (before reveal).

## POWER+ (Batter)
*"Swinging for the fences"*

| You... | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **WIN battle** | Tier +1 (weak→solid, solid→strong). Already strong? +1 to result |
| **LOSE battle** | Tier -1 (strong→solid, solid→weak). Already weak? **Swinging K** |

## CONTACT+ (Batter)
*"Just get on base"*

| You... | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **WIN battle** | Result ≤4 = **WALK**. Max hit = single (no extra bases) |
| **LOSE battle** | Runners do NOT advance on the out |

## FASTBALL+ or CURVEBALL+ (Pitcher)
*"Going for the strikeout"*

| You... | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **WIN battle** | +2 to result roll (pushes toward K zone) |
| **LOSE battle** | Batter gets **FREE BASE** (walk) |

*Changeup has no plus move - it's the safe middle option.*

# DESIGN NOTES

**Why this works:**
1. **Situation management** - You're playing baseball decisions, not simulating pitches
2. **Risk/reward** - Every plus move is a bet
3. **Agency** - "Who wants it, rolls it" gives control to the acting player
4. **Tension** - Simultaneous selection, snake eyes drama
5. **Tactile** - Fidget selectors, dice rolling satisfaction

**Future: Player Cards**
- Power hitters: +1 to strong tier results
- Speedsters: +2 to steal/stretch rolls
- Contact specialists: +1 to getting on base
- Pitchers: Bonus to specific pitch types
