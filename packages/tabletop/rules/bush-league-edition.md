# Cheddar Bob: Bush League

**No excuses. No equipment. Just hands and dice.**

*Bush league (adj.)*: amateur, informal, scrappy. The way baseball was meant to be played - anywhere, anytime.

---

## What You Need
- 2 six-sided dice per player (or dice apps)
- Your hands (for RPS)

## The Core Rule: 7-9 is the Strike Zone
Remember this one number range for everything:
- **≤6** = Weak
- **7-9** = Solid (the "strike zone")
- **10+** = Strong

---

## Game Flow

### 1. SELECT
Both players secretly choose their pitch/swing approach using Rock-Paper-Scissors:

| Hand | Pitch | Why It Makes Sense |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| 🪨 Rock | Fastball | Throw a rock - hard and straight |
| 📄 Paper | Changeup | Floats like paper |
| ✂️ Scissors | Breaking Ball | Moves and cuts, doesn't fly straight |

### 2. REVEAL
Both players throw their hands simultaneously.

### 3. CALC MODS
- **RPS Winner:** Gets +2 to their battle roll
- **RPS Tie:** No modifier for either player

### 4. BATTLE
Both players roll 2d6 + modifiers. Higher total wins the at-bat.
- **Ties:** Re-roll until someone wins

**Important:** The winner's battle roll determines their **OFFSET** for the result:
- Weak (≤6): Offset 0
- Solid (7-9): Offset 1
- Strong (10+): Offset 2

### 5. RESULT
The winner rolls 2d6 again. This determines which outcome they get from their offset window.

## Outcome Tables

### Batter Wins

**Base List:** `OUT → OUT → 1B → 2B → HR`

| Battle Zone | Offset | Weak Roll (≤6) | Solid (7-9) | Strong (10+) |
|-------------|--------|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| Weak ≤6     | 0      | OUT            | OUT         | 1B           |
| Solid 7-9   | 1      | OUT            | 1B          | 2B           |
| Strong 10+  | 2      | 1B             | 2B          | HR           |

### Pitcher Wins

**Base List:** `BB → O-RA → O-RC → O-RF → DP`

| Battle Zone | Offset | Weak Roll (≤6) | Solid (7-9) | Strong (10+) |
|-------------|--------|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| Weak ≤6     | 0      | BB             | O-RA        | O-RC         |
| Solid 7-9   | 1      | O-RA           | O-RC        | O-RF         |
| Strong 10+  | 2      | O-RC           | O-RF        | DP           |

## Outcome Definitions

### Batter Outcomes
| Code | Result |
|------|--------|
| OUT | Batter is out |
| 1B | Single - batter to first |
| 2B | Double - batter to second |
| HR | Home Run - batter scores, all runners score |

### Pitcher Outcomes
| Code | Result | Runner Effect |
|------|--------|---------------|
| BB | Walk | Batter to 1B, forced runners advance |
| O-RA | Out, Runners Advance | Sac fly, grounder to right side - runners move up one base |
| O-RC | Out, Runner Challenge | Runner may attempt to advance - if they go, it's a 50/50 battle roll |
| O-RF | Out, Runners Freeze | No runner advancement allowed |
| DP | Double Play | 2 outs (any runners), players narrate the story |

---

## Runner Challenge (O-RC) Resolution
When O-RC occurs and a runner decides to go:
1. Both players roll 2d6 (no modifiers)
2. Higher roll wins
3. **Runner wins:** Safe at next base
4. **Defense wins:** Runner is out
5. **Tie:** Re-roll

## Quick Reference

```
FLOW:    SELECT → REVEAL → CALC MODS → BATTLE → RESULT

RPS:     🪨 Rock=FB  📄 Paper=CH  ✂️ Scissors=CB
         Winner gets +2

ZONES:   ≤6 Weak | 7-9 Solid | 10+ Strong

BATTER:  OUT-OUT-1B-2B-HR
PITCHER: BB-ORA-ORC-ORF-DP

## Design Notes

**Cheddar Bob: Bush League** strips the game down to pure competition. No fancy equipment, no complex rules - just read your opponent and roll.

The magic number **7-9** (the "strike zone") is the only range you need to remember - it applies to both battle rolls and result rolls.

The RPS pitch selection maps intuitively:
- **Rock** is hard and fast (fastball)
- **Paper** floats (changeup)
- **Scissors** cut and move (breaking ball)

Every at-bat tells a story. The outcome codes give players narrative freedom to describe what happened.

## Critical Rolls

- **Snake Eyes (2):** Critical Fail - worst outcome for the roller
  - Batter wins battle, rolls snake eyes → OUT (snatched defeat from victory)
  - Pitcher wins battle, rolls snake eyes → BB (plunked the batter!)

- **Boxcars (12):** Critical Hit - best outcome for the roller
  - Batter wins battle, rolls boxcars → HR (crushed it!)
  - Pitcher wins battle, rolls boxcars → DP (turned two!)
