## APPROACH SELECTION

### Pitcher Picks (one of three)
| Pitch | Plus Available? |
|-------|-----------------|
| ⚡ **FASTBALL** | Yes → FASTBALL+ |
| 🌀 **CURVEBALL** | Yes → CURVEBALL+ |
| 🔄 **CHANGEUP** | No (safe middle) |

### Batter Picks (one of three)
| Approach | Plus Available? |
|----------|-----------------|
| 💪 **POWER** | Yes → POWER+ |
| 🎯 **CONTROL** | No (safe middle) |
| ✋ **CONTACT** | Yes → CONTACT+ |

---

## RPS MATCHUP (±1 modifier)

```
        CB → Power → FB → Contact → CH → Control → CB
```

| Pitcher ↓ / Batter → | Power | Control | Contact |
| -------------------- | :---: | :-----: | :-----: |
| **Fastball**         |   B   |         |    P    |
| **Curveball**        |   P   |    B    |         |
| **Changeup**         |       |    P    |    B    |

**Winner: +1 / Loser: -1** (empty = TIE)

**Memory:**
- **Batter:** Power crushes FB, Control handles CB, Contact reads CH
- **Pitcher:** FB overpowers Contact, CB fools Power, CH disrupts Control

---

## BATTLE ROLL

Both roll 2d6 + RPS modifier. **Higher total wins.**

| Winner's Total | Tier |
|----------------|------|
| ≤8 | **Weak** |
| 9-10 | **Solid** |
| 11+ | **Strong** |

### Snake Eyes (1-1)
- Pitcher rolls 🐍 → Batter gets STRONG tier
- Batter rolls 🐍 → Automatic OUT

---

## PLUS MOVES

### POWER+ (Batter declares before battle)
*"Swinging for the fences"*

| Battle Result | Effect |
|---------------|--------|
| **WIN** | Tier +1 (weak→solid→strong). Already strong? +1 to result roll |
| **LOSE** | Tier -1 (strong→solid→weak). Already weak? **Swinging K** |

### CONTACT+ (Batter declares before battle)
*"Just get on base"*

| Battle Result | Effect |
|---------------|--------|
| **WIN** | Result ≤4 = **WALK** (instead of out). Max hit = single |
| **LOSE** | Runners do NOT advance on the out |

### FASTBALL+ or CURVEBALL+ (Pitcher declares before battle)
*"Going for the strikeout"*

| Battle Result | Effect |
|---------------|--------|
| **WIN** | +2 to result roll (toward K zone) |
| **LOSE** | Batter gets **FREE BASE** (walk) |

## RESULT TABLES

| Roll | Weak | Solid | Strong |
|------|:----:|:-----:|:------:|
| ≤6 | **OUT** | 1B | 1B |
| 7-9 | 1B | 2B | 2B |
| 10+ | 1B+ | 2B+ | **HR** |

- **Snake eyes = OUT** (even though you won)
- **+** = Stretch roll (9+ safe, ≤8 out)
- **CONTACT+ cap:** Max result is 1B (no 2B/HR)

### PITCHER WINS → Roll 2d6

| Roll | Weak | Solid | Strong |
|------|:----:|:-----:|:------:|
| ≤6 | GB | Flyout | Lineout |
| 7-9 | GB | Flyout | Lineout |
| 10+ | GB | K swing | K look |

- **Snake eyes = HBP** (batter reaches)
- With runners: Roll for advancement (≤8 advance, 9-10 hold, 11+ DP)

---

## QUICK REFERENCE

```
MATCHUPS:
  Batter:  Power beats FB | Control beats CB | Contact beats CH
  Pitcher: FB beats Contact | CB beats Power | CH beats Control

TIERS: ≤8 Weak | 9-10 Solid | 11+ Strong

PLUS MOVES:
  POWER+    Win: tier+1    Lose: tier-1 (or K)
  CONTACT+  Win: walk≤4    Lose: no runner advance
  FB+/CB+   Win: +2 result Lose: free base
```

---

## EXAMPLE AT-BAT

```
Pitcher: FASTBALL+ (going for K)
Batter:  POWER+ (swinging for fences)

MATCHUP: FB vs Power = Batter +1

BATTLE:
  Pitcher rolls [4,3] = 7
  Batter rolls [5,4] +1 = 10
  → BATTER WINS (solid tier)
  → POWER+ bonus: tier becomes STRONG

RESULT (batter rolls):
  [3,5] = 8, Strong tier
  → 2B (double!)

If pitcher had won, POWER+ penalty would drop batter's
tier AND pitcher's FASTBALL+ would add +2 to result...
likely a strikeout!
```

## SITUATION GUIDE

| Situation | Batter Should Consider | Pitcher Should Consider |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Behind late | POWER+ (need runs!) | Play safe |
| Runner on 3rd, <2 out | CONTACT+ (just score him) | FB+/CB+ (get the K) |
| Bases loaded | POWER+ (grand slam?) | Play safe (no walks) |
| 2 strikes | Play safe | FB+/CB+ (put away pitch) |
| Up big | CONTACT+ (don't give outs) | FB+/CB+ (end it fast) |

---
