# Cheddar Bob v5.3 — Playtest Rules

> A fast baseball game using just hands and dice.
> This version adds STANCE (pitch location) for more strategic depth.

## What You Need
- 2 dice per player (or share)
- Your hands (for RPS)
- 4 cards or coins for stance (UP, DOWN, IN, OUT)
- This rules sheet

## Game Flow

Each at-bat has 4 phases:

### 1. STRATEGY (Rock-Paper-Scissors)
Both players throw RPS simultaneously.

| You Throw | Beats |
|-----------|-------|
| Rock (Fastball) | Scissors |
| Paper (Changeup) | Rock |
| Scissors (Breaking Ball) | Paper |

**Winner gets +2 to their battle roll.** Tie = no bonus.

### 2. STANCE (Pitch Location)
Both players secretly choose a location, then reveal simultaneously.

**Locations:** UP, DOWN, IN, OUT

| Result | Who Wins | Modifier |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Match** (same location) | Batter anticipated! | Batter +1 |
| **Fooled** (same axis, opposite) | Pitcher deceived! | Pitcher +1 |
| **Miss** (different axis) | Neutral | No modifier |

**Axes:**
- Vertical: UP ↔ DOWN
- Horizontal: IN ↔ OUT

*Example: Batter picks UP, Pitcher picks DOWN → Same axis (vertical), opposite choice → Pitcher +1*

*Example: Batter picks UP, Pitcher picks IN → Different axes → No modifier*

### 3. BATTLE (Roll-Off)
Both players roll 2d6 and add ALL their modifiers.

- **Higher total wins** and controls the result
- **Tie?** Re-roll until someone wins

The winner's roll determines the **tier**:
| Roll Total | Tier |
|------------|------|
| 2-6 | Weak |
| 7-9 | Solid |
| 10+ | Strong |

### 4. RESULT (Winner Rolls Again)
The battle winner rolls 2d6 again to determine the outcome.

**If BATTER won the battle:**

| Battle Tier | Weak (2-6) | Solid (7-9) | Strong (10+) |
|-------------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| Weak | OUT | OUT | 1B |
| Solid | OUT | 1B | 2B |
| Strong | 1B | 2B | HR |

**If PITCHER won the battle:**

| Battle Tier | Weak (2-6) | Solid (7-9) | Strong (10+) |
|-------------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| Weak | WALK | OUT | OUT |
| Solid | OUT | OUT | OUT |
| Strong | OUT | OUT | DP |

### Critical Rolls!
- **Snake Eyes (2)** = Worst outcome (OUT for batter, WALK for pitcher)
- **Boxcars (12)** = Best outcome (HR for batter, DP for pitcher)

## Modifier Summary

| Source | Winner | Modifier |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Strategy (RPS) | RPS winner | +2 |
| Stance (Location) | Batter matched | +1 to batter |
| Stance (Location) | Pitcher fooled | +1 to pitcher |

**Max possible modifier: +3** (won RPS and stance)

## Runner Movement

| Hit | Runners Move |
|-----|-------------|
| 1B (Single) | All advance 1 base |
| 2B (Double) | All advance 2 bases |
| HR (Home Run) | Everyone scores! |
